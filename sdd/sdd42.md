# SDD 4.2 Pre-Defined Functions - len()
# Pre-Defined Functions

Pre-Defined Functions are pre-written, pre-tested computer programs that perform common functions that programmers require. Using them saves the programmer time (they don't have to solve common problems ) and because they have been pre-tested, the programmer can use them with confidence knowing that will not produce unreliable results.

  ## Learning Intention
  1. Use a pre-defined function to return the length of a data structure
## Success Criteria
1. Use the `len()` function to generate the length of a string
2. Use the `len()` function to generate the length of an array
3. Use the value generated by the `len()` function with a fixed loop

## The len() function

We can use the `len()` function to generate the length of any string or array.

### Generating the length of a string


```python
example = "Banana"
lengthOfExample = len(example)
print (lengthOfExample)
```
Would display the value of `lengthOfExample` as `6`.

----
### Generating the length of an array
In this example we won't assign the length to a variable, just print it out.
```python
classNames = ["Leon","Harry","Cameron","India","Aidan"]
print (len(classNames))
```
Would display the value of `5`. 

You will remember that array `index` values begin from `0`, so you might have thought the array length would be 4 but the length of data structures like arrays does not start from the number `0` it counts the actual (like a human!) number of data objects within.

----

## Using the len() function to set the number of repeats in a fixed loop

We can use the value generated by the `len()` function as the amount of times to repeat a fixed (`for`) loop.

```python
classNames = ["Leon","Harry","Cameron","India","Aidan"]
for z in range(len(classNames)):
	print ("Hello, and welcome to the class!")
```
Would print out
```
Hello, and welcome to the class!
Hello, and welcome to the class!
Hello, and welcome to the class!
Hello, and welcome to the class!
Hello, and welcome to the class!
```
We know from above that `len(classNames)` would generate the number 5, so essentially when python runs the fixed loop code `for z in range(len(classNames))` it is translated to `for z in range(len(5))`.

## Task
In `main.py` follow the instructions in each comment to use the `len()` function.
