# SDD Challenge 1: Quidditch  

There are two ways to score during a game of Quidditch. Firstly, the Chasers can score a goal by getting possession of the Quaffle, then entering the opposition's scoring area andthrowing it successfully through one of the three hoops. This gives the team 10 points.
The second way to score points is for the Seeker to gain possession of the Golden Snitch. Doing so, scores the team 150 points and immediately ends the game.
