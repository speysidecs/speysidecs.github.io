# SDD Challenge 2: Code Breaker 
The computer generates a 4 digit code
The user types in a 4 digit code, one digit at a time which is their guess.
The computer tells them how many digits they guessed correctly.

## Extension Challenge: 
The computer tells them how many digits are guessed correctly in the correct place and how many digits have been guessed correctly but in the wrong place.

## Extension Challenge 2:
The user gets 12 guesses to either win – guess the right code. Or lose – run out of guesses. 

## Extension Challenge 3:
The program tells you whether the digit is higher or lower.
