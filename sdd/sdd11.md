# SDD 1.1 Basic Variable Assignment
In computer programming we use _variables_ to store data. You can think of a variable like a box with a label on it, which stores a value inside. We can use this variable in place of a known value in our code.

## Learning Intentions
  1. Assigning variables in Programming
  2. Data types of variables in computer programming
## Success Criteria
1. Create variables of each type in the Python programming language
2. Identify and describe four different variable types in computer programming
---
# Examples

To store a variable we use name and value pairs. On the left hand side of the name and value pair we give the variable a _meaningful_ name which we can use later in the program. On the right hand side, we assign the value (the piece of data to store).

We should use meaningful variable names to describe our variables. If we were writing a program for a vet, and  we wanted to store the age of a dog, we might call a variable:
```python
ageOfDog = 5
```
Variable names should start with a lowercase letter, cannot contain spaces, and each new word in  a name should begin with a capital.

### Example 1 - storing a number
In programming whole numbers (numbers without a decimal point) are known as **integers**. The example below shows two integers being stored.
```python
age = 10
numberOfMonths = 12 
```
We can perform maths on integers.

### Example 2 - storing text
In programming any text data (collections of characters like letters, numbers and symbols) are known as **strings**. The example below shows two strings being stored.
```python
firstName = "Marc"
schoolSubject = "Computing Science"
```
Notice that strings are contained within speech marks. This tells Python that we are storing a strong, but also allows strings to contain a space.

### Example 3 - storing real numbers
In programming, a real number is any number with a decimal point 
```python
height = 5.7
smallNumber = 0.002
````
Like integers, we can perform maths on real numbers.

### Example 4 - storing booleans
In programming a boolean is a True or False value. We cannot do any maths on them. They can be stored in a tiny amount of storage called a binary digit or bit. 
```python
attendance = True
workComplete = False
```
Notice how the words True and False start with a capital letter - this is important.

## Task
In the Python section you will see some boiler plate code (that is the name for code I have created for you).
1. Complete the comment section at the top to put your name at the top (firstname only) and today's date.
2. In the comments that follow you will see tasks to create variables, for example:
```python
#Create a variable to store the Car Number Plate - NV68 YTN
```
Underneath this comment create a name and value pair to store the data in a variable.
