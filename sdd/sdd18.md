# Program Analysis
Write a program that asks the user for their name and which subject they are studying. The program should display a message telling the student by name which room to go to for that class (make up the room numbers if you need to).  
You should include at least 3 subjects and have a message such as 'I don't know which room that class is in' for any you don't include.
 
Example - for input of 'Campbell' and 'Computing' might get an output of 'Hi Campbell, go to room 1 for Computing'

## Inputs
* The name of the pupil
* The name of a subject they want to find the room for

## Processes
* Check to see if the subject matches a room number

## Output
* Display a message telling the student, by name, which room to go to or a message saying "I don't know what room that class is in"
