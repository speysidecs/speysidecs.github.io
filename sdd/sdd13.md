# SDD 1.3 Maths Operations Using Variables
We know how to store data from users inside variables (input) and we know how to display those values using the the `print()` function (output). This is not much use - unless we start doing something with the data and changing it in some way. 

Changing the values that are input into our programs is known as carrying out a *process*. 

This makes up the basic three stages that programs go through.
1. Input (get data in)
2. Process (do something with the data)
3. Output (display the result)

## Learning Intentions
  1. Manipulate data using mathematical operators
## Success Criteria
1. I have used the `+` operator to change data in my program
2. I have used the `-` operator to change data in my program
3. I have used the `*` operator to change data in my program
4. I have used the `/` operator to change data in my program
5. I have used the `**` operator to change data in my program

# Code Examples
## Addition (adding)
We can use the `+` operator to perform addition (adding).
```python
age = 10
age = 10+1
print (age)
```
```
11
```

## Subtracting (taking away)
We can use the `-` operator to perform subtraction (take away).
```python
age = 10
age = 10-1
print (age)
```
```
9
```

## Multiply (times)
We can use the `*` operator to multiply a number (times it).

```python
age = 10
age = 10*2
print (age)
```
```
20
```

## Divide 
We can use the `/` operator to divide a number.

```python
age = 10
age = 10/2
print (age)
```
```
5
```

## Exponent (to the power of) 
We can use the `**` operator to multiply a number by itself to the power of the number of times beside the symbol. For example below means 10 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 10.

```python
age = 10
age = 10**3
print (age)
```
```
1000
```
